# Automation Troubleshooting Fixes

## Issue: Automation not replying to tweets or logging accomplishments

### Root Causes Identified and Fixed:

#### 1. Missing Accomplishment Emission (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem**: When tweets were liked, the action was logged but no accomplishment event was emitted to the UI.

**Location**: `src/automation/index.js` around line 1500
**Fix**: Added missing accomplishment emission:
```javascript
this.emit('automation-accomplishment', `❤️ Liked tweet by @${tweet.author}: ${tweet.tweetText}`);
```

#### 2. Configuration Not Passed to Automation Engine
**Problem**: Focus keywords, skip keywords, and priority users weren't being passed from the UI to the automation engine.

**Location**: `src/automation/index.js` in the `start()` method
**Fix**: Added missing config properties:
```javascript
replyTone: config.replyTone || 'Friendly',
focusKeywords: config.focusKeywords || [],
skipKeywords: config.skipKeywords || [],
priorityUsers: config.priorityUsers || [],
```

#### 3. Non-Interactive Logs (UX IMPROVEMENT)
**Problem**: Log entries weren't using the `processLogText` function to make usernames and keywords clickable.

**Location**: `src/App.jsx` - `TypewriterLogLine` component
**Fix**: 
- Modified `TypewriterLogLine` to accept `processLogText` function
- Updated log rendering to pass the processing function
- Now usernames and keywords become clickable after typing animation completes

#### 4. Enhanced Debugging (DIAGNOSTIC IMPROVEMENT)
**Problem**: Hard to diagnose why automation wasn't finding suitable tweets.

**Fixes Added**:
- Debug logging for current filters in `monitorFeed()`
- New test button "Test Automation Scoring" in UI
- Backend method `testAutomationScoring()` for debugging score calculations

### Testing Recommendations:

1. **Start the automation** and check the log for:
   - `[DEBUG] Current filters` message showing your keywords/users
   - `[TWEET SCORE]` messages showing how tweets are being scored
   - `❤️ Liked tweet by @username` accomplishments appearing

2. **Use the Test Automation Scoring button** to verify scoring logic works with your current filters

3. **Check that your keywords are effective**:
   - Use broad keywords like "gm", "crypto", "web3" if nothing too specific
   - Avoid too many skip keywords that might block everything
   - Add some priority users to guarantee interactions

### Debug Commands:

If still having issues, check browser console and Electron logs for:
- Navigation errors
- Tweet parsing failures  
- API key issues
- Score calculation problems

### Score Ranges for Reference:

- **Priority users**: +1000 points (guaranteed interaction)
- **Focus keywords exact match**: +200 points
- **Focus keywords partial**: +100 points  
- **GM detection**: +75-150 points
- **Questions**: +100 points
- **Skip keywords**: -1000 points (blocks interaction)

Typical good score for interaction: 25+ points
Typical score for reply: 50+ points

The automation should now properly find tweets, like them, show accomplishments, and log detailed scoring information for debugging.
